IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card/ Candidate Task Card.

Describe a happy event of your life.



You should say:



    what it was

    when it happened

    where it happened



and explain why it was a happy event.





Follow-up Questions:

* What do you think is important in achieving happiness?

* How do you celebrate some happy events?

* What do the camera and video play in celebrating?



Possible Answer 1:

I can remember many happy events of my life and out of those, I would like to talk about the event that I can still remember vividly regarding my success in the board exam. The moment I heard that I had been awarded a scholarship based on my performance in the board exam, I became the happiest man in the world. This was indeed a very happy moment for me as it is something I was looking forward to achieving and the news made my parents quite happy and proud.



I spent almost a month with great anxiety regarding my result publication. I started speculating so many things and many of them were negative. I could hardly keep away the tensions about my upcoming result. The result was so important that my college admission would mostly depend on it. I could not sleep well in the night before the result publishing. I think this is a common anxiety for students and I was familiar with this type of anxiety. However, this particular exam results game me more nightmares than any other time of my life. ",16

One of the greatest pleasures of being in Chennai is your proximity to a lot of one day getawaysa| and nothing more exciting than planning a trip.



Even though we are in the first quarter of the year I have exhausted my leaves due to our clichA(c) dialogue personal issuesa.



Now that canat stop me from holidaying ;-)



When I sat down to plan the places to visit on my bucket list the first one that popped up was Velankanni, to visit the shrine of lady of good health.



In times of sickness this was always on my mind that when I get back to optimum health I will go and stand face to face with this mother as a sign of gratitude.



Hailing from down south in Kerala the trips to Velankanni were often registered as tedious, dirty, long trips.



I decided to create a better memory and enjoy my trip.



I did my research on climate to start with, modes of transport, hotels food, mass timings, and other tourist spots around Velankanni.



For the last two weeks I have been doing my research on the internet about Velankanni and speaking to the best hotels available for tariffs.



Something or the other came up and my two day leaves were not working out.



I planned a one day trip.



Departure - 10pm Chennai the busy Koyembedu bus stand



Arrival at the holy soil a 4.30 am.



I rushed back from my hectic weekend at work and quickly packed my backpack with clothes and other necessities, cookies to munch on and water.



Not to give extra strain on my back I preferred a Sleeper bus. There were hardly buses to Velankanni (surprisingly).I took a non a/c sleeper bus as A/c was not available. The humidity currently is beyond words could explain. I kept my fingers crossed that I should not fall ill or claustrophobic in the bus.



I thanked all the bloggers and their wonderful reviews which were so helpful choose the bus and hotel I wanted to stay in.



I would be using the hotel only during the day to refresh and catch some sleep which I have been deprived of.



Koyembedu and travel from that super busy noisy bus stand was not new to me. I sat down waiting for my bus and remembered my college days of how reckless and daring I was to walk in to koyembedu buy a random ticket to Nagercoil and further take buses to Trivandrum.



Today in spite of all the planning I was worried,



The bus reminded me of a fish .Tall and sleek and way too silvery.



Even though these thoughts happen on my thought bubble I laugh out loud, followed by an embarrassment.



The sleeper was an upper berth and had sliding windows. The bus started to move and the air fought to gush in.



I didnt want to reach velaknni at 4.30.I prayed hard for a delay in departure contradicting to the prayers of fellow passengers.



I had a small talk with the bus driver and conductor and asked him if he could drop me  at amathakulama(this was the landmark the hotel reception gave me.



After a long halt at a toll before reaching Velankanni the bus pulls in to Velankanni by 5.30.The sun was out and I was a happy child. A proactive bus conductor asks for a couple of directions and drops me at VPN hotel in Matakulam or Our ladyas tank.



The bookings we done prior to my visit and they offered 10% discount plus complimentary breakfast after my sweet talk and enquiries.



The hotel was relatively new and the rooms were spotlessly clean .



I hit the bed and woke up at 8.30am.A quick shower and nibbled through a bit of everything on the buffet, took my camera and stood outside the hotel.



Being very enthusiastic and experimental that morning, I took a shortcut to walk to our ladyas tank.



I walked and walked through a dry dusty road with no signs of a tank. Occasionally there was a signage pointing to the direction I was walking to. I finally reached my destination. There were trees with cradles tied all over with bright yellow threads.



There was the tank with a metal covering and a cross and Hail Mary stencilled on it. I could look through the small holes and see a reflection of it in the water beneath.



I walked towards the Shrine of our lady of Good health and by then the sun was at its peak. Sipped from a bottle of water I was carrying and I could see devotees crawling towards the tank from the church as a belief. I saw an exhausted woman in the verge of collapsing on the sand. She drank water from my bottle and I proceeded to the church. There was a malayalam mass happening at that time and I took that as a sign from Mother Mary Welcoming me to her abode.



I sat on the floor outside as the church was full of Malayalam speaking devotees. Post the service I entered the church and I quickly tried to remember the names I had registered in my mind of people who needed special blessings.



I felt that I was pressurised to pray and not to forget.



I did my generalised template of prayer and prayed for My parents, grandparents, uncles ,aunts, cousins, their children, relatives, neighbours in all houses I have lived in, people I have met in all cities that I have lived in, my school, colleges, juniors , seniors , classmates, faculties, teachers, mentors, guides,doctors,people who are unwell, troubled, colleagues at work, bosses.



I have always found myself in a very difficult spot trying to pray in a busy church. I never get a Holy feeling or connect.



There is always suffering around.



Visited a museum near the church with pictorial depiction of how mother Mary appeared to the milk man .The church was founded its founding is attributed to three miracles: the apparition of Mary and Jesus to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the survival of Portuguese sailors assaulted by a violent sea storm.



I walked through the dirty crowded humid roads with fruit, shell, and pirated CD vendors and reached the beach.



The sipped some tender coconut water and clicked a few pictures of the ocean.



I ate raw mangoes and cashew apple.



The resinous cashew juice burnt my stomach as I walked back to where I could take a rickshaw back to the hotel. I ordered food to the room and slept. I was content that a long term dream came true and I was relaxed after the good sleep and food at the hotel.



I lay on the upper berth looking at the beautiful full moon from the window and the wind stroking my hair getting recaps of the day which has gone bya|in spirituality and relaxation. I would probably not want to go back to Velankanni but I have memories well etched.

Weare starting a new series on the Buffer blog today with great tips and insights from Joel, CEO here at Buffer. Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:

Today itas a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, Iave started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.

One of the most important things Iave learned during this time is that I perform the best when Iam happy. It really does change everything. If Iam happy then Iam more productive when hacking code, Iam better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.

Iave found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where Iam not feeling 100%. So here are 6 of the things I do:

1. Wake up early

One of the things I love about running my own startup is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my daily routine.

Through experimentation, Iave found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, Iave found I crave that early morning feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused. Gretchen Rubin from The Happiness Project mentioned something similar a recent article:

aI get up at 6:00 a.m. every day, even on weekends and vacation, because I love it.a

Waking up early every day requires discipline, especially about what time I sleep. Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.

The power with your mornings is that you will have about 25,000 of them in your life, so thereas a lot of room to experiment.

2. Exercise daily

aWe found that people who are more physically active have more pleasant-activated feelings than people who are less activea a Amanda Hyde

In the last three years, Iave gone from dabbling with exercise to it becoming something I do every weekday without fail. At first I had no idea what to do at the gym, so I asked my brother, whoas a personal trainer. I then went a few times with a good friend and soon I was hooked.

Over time, I developed this into a daily ritual so strong that I feel a pull towards it, and by doing it consistently I feel fantastic and can more easily take on other challenges. I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. Iave also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.

3. Have a habit of disengagement

aThe richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal a Loehr and Schwarz, The Power of Full Engagement

As I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which Iave done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else. This prompts reflection and relaxation.",29

Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores.

During the meeting we cannot stop smiling and pouring positive emotions to each other. I feel crazily happy because we have finally met.

We met this December twice and spended a day together. 

now here is the real thing.. He likes holding my hand a lot.. whether we were walking or were in the metro... He wasn't ready to let go of my hand. We went to movie together , there too he was holding my hand all the time.. and a few times he even kind of kissed my hand. He himself told me that he likes it when i asked him jokingly that whats with this holding hands. 

  i found it weird because though he was treating me special  but these things I didn't understand  because I don't think he thinks of me that way. I'm not able to understand  his psychology. Maybe he's a nan? Or pervert?  Now he wants to meet again this time when he will come.",18

We havent seen each other in more than a decade in this april, 2017, we will finally reunite. It will be an emotional yet exciting feeling and I bet you we won't stop hugging each other. Were both so excited. The reason why we couldnat see each other since then was because of the constant schooling between the both of us among other things, but this year is the year that it will happen again. I still remember her sound and the ways she was with me, but I am sure things may have changed because we are much older. Were about 2 years between each other and were like sisters. We try to keep in touch with each other often from Facebook and among other social networking sites and as well as communicating on the phone. She is such a sweetheart. I cannot wait for all the cousins to gather have a huge family reunion at my cousins wedding. A nice picture is required for sure. October seems so far away, but I am not counting the days anymore and going with the flow.

93896,3m,"Itas a trip to Kanyakumari from Bangalore. Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of mainland India and is surrounded by three water bodies. Bay of Bengal towards east, Indian Ocean in south and Arabian Sea in west. I think it is the only place to see sun rise and sun set in water bodies in India. Kanyakumari town is named after the goddess Kanyakumari amman, a popular deity of the area. Legend has it that the goddess Parvathi in one of her incarnation as devi Kanya did penance on one of the rock of this landas end to obtain the hand of lord Siva. Tip of the day a Never ever wear any footwear which is difficult to open in Kanyakumari like sneakers or other shoes. Every place you visit, you have to open your shoe even in museum. 2nd tip of the day a Always wear socks to protect your feet from heat. 3rd tip a Protect yourself with best sunscreen lotion you have. 4th one a everybody speaks Hindi. 5th one a Hardly any non veg restaurant. Everyone is veg and I figured out only one non veg which became my favorite. Ok ok lots of free trip.



Its 22-March-2017 10:30 PM, we have boarded Nagercoil Express in Bangalore City Junction station. Since this train does not have any pantry, we had to get packed food. When I am traveling I am always double hungry than normal days. The train was full, but it was totally empty once it reached Madurai next day at 10:00 am. Runai and I were thinking whether the train will go till Nagercoil or not. Then I saw there was another family far end in the same coach.



We reached Nagercoil Junction station at 23-March-2012 2:30 pm. We came out of the station and saw lots of taxi waiting to take you to Kanyakumari. We know that they are going to take you on a ride if we hire them, so thought of taking a bus because it 20 KM from Nagercoil to Kanyakumari. There lots of local public bus very frequent to go to Kanyakumari. But then I came to know that it will take 2 hours to reach in this type of bus because it will go everywhere and will stop in every place. One person told us that if we walk a kilometer from there to reach highway, then we will get direct express bus for Kanyakumari and will take hardly 20 min to reach. Along with us there were another family who came to highway road bus stop. After waiting for 10 min, a bus came and we boarded that bus. Ticket was Rs. 18 per head and we reached Kanyakumari around 3:30 pm. We asked one fellow passenger to drop us in Kanyakumari Railway station. I had a printed google map of all the places from Kanyakumari Railway station. Anyway we got down and saw that itas the entrance for Our Lady of Ransom Church.



We decided to go to the church and then search for hotel. We did that promptly. Itas a beautiful church. A bit of information about this church a Located on the shoreline of the Bay of Bengal, the 100 year old Church in dedicated to Mother Mary. It was built in the Gothic style of architecture with a strong Portuguese influence. It is 153 feet high and is crowned with a cross of pure gold. One lady near the entrance asked me if I know Tamil and I replied yes. May be she knows only Tamil and wanted to communicate something important. She told me that behind the church, there is a staircase and on top there is a new smaller church build and we also get to see beautiful view of Bay of Bengal from the terrace. We opened our shoe and went inside the church. Interior was very simple just opposite to the decoration on outside. Then we went backstage and went to that new church which was pretty small and from the terrace we can see the beautiful sea. We could not take any picture because we did not yet open our luggage.



Next was our hotel search. Tell you something, if there are 100 houses for local resident, then there are 1000 hotels for tourist. So we decided to go near the beach and get a hotel. In the midway we found a budget Hotel Sangam. We wanted to enquire the rate and they told Rs. 1300 and 1000 for A/C and Non A/C double bed. We told its too much and we were about to leave and the receptionist told us, that they have room for Rs 600. Basically itas the same room and since it is off season, they lower the rate and I instantly booked it for 3 days. After refreshing we went to the restaurant downstairs. We did not wanted something fancy so ordered for 2 plates of lunch meal. Tell you something, I donat know what they gave in food but I till late night I was not hungry. So we decided that we are not going to go in that restaurant anymore.



We headed toward Triveny Sangam (which is the meeting point of three water bodies). I am confused here. Till now I know that there are 3 different Triveny Sangam (one near Srirangapatnam, another near Coorg and next is this one). If a traveler ask for Triveny Sangam details, where will the person refer to? Anyway itas a rocky place and no sea beach as such. There are plenty of shops for sea shells and they are pretty cheap AMO. Big shells were for Rs. 200 whereas in Chennai they are sold for min Rs. 500 for bad quality ones. We can have a so-so view for sun rise and sun set from here with lots of obstacles. After the sun set and few photographs, we left the place.",69

So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasnat until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I havent made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didnt expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. Iam really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",10

It reached to such an extent that my manager at work spotted that I was mentally disturbed and asked me to take a week off and get back when I am completely fine.



I took the next train back home, uncertain where my life will go from that point. I reached home and the time came to talk to my parents and start resolving things. The usual livid me, ended up being composed and steady when I spoke with them. I did not get emotional or melodramatic. I just behaved like an actual adult and was clear on what I wanted from my life- be it career or marriage.



The thing that made me happy was that after all the drama, my mother remarked how well behaved I was during the entire ordeal. To quote her, "" I expected you to throw a tantrum, yell and be harsh while putting forth your point. But you proved me wrong. Since when are you grounded and composed? Anyway, you dealt with all these very well, Ammu. Guess you are growing up. ""

I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasnat until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I havent made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didnt expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. Iam really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.

It was one of the last times that all of us were together because shortly after that two of our group left to go abroad and they'll be there for about two years before they come back home.



So, the graduation ceremony was in the main auditorium of the university and everyone was there, all the students, faculty members and of course family and other invited guests. There were the usual speeches, presentation of degrees to graduates and a few other things which the faculty had organized, and then after we organized a big lunch.



There was my own family and three of my friends and their families as well, so it was quite an occasion. We had this family lunch at a local restaurant which we had booked for the afternoon. It was a really special time having all the most important people in my life together at the same time.



Later on, when the family members had left we went out to a bar and had a few beers together just me and my friends. Looking back on it now, it was one of the happiest days of my life I think - we all felt like we had really achieved something graduating and that particular day was really good for all of us.

96303,3m," happiness is a fuzzy concept and can mean many different things to many people. Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing. At least one author defines happiness as contentment.[6] Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.[7",6

It was one of the last times that all of us were together because shortly after that two of our group left to go abroad and they'll be there for about two years before they come back home.



So, the graduation ceremony was in the main auditorium of the university and everyone was there, all the students, faculty members and of course family and other invited guests. There were the usual speeches, presentation of degrees to graduates and a few other things which the faculty had organized, and then after we organized a big lunch.



There was my own family and three of my friends and their families as well, so it was quite an occasion. We had this family lunch at a local restaurant which we had booked for the afternoon. It was a really special time having all the most important people in my life together at the same time.



Later on, when the family members had left we went out to a bar and had a few beers together just me and my friends. Looking back on it now, it was one of the happiest days of my life I think - we all felt like we had really achieved something graduating and that particular day was really good for all of us. I hope that maybe in a couple of years we can arrange a sort of reunion - so that we can all get together again and catch up with each other.

The first time I experienced what experts call ""Reverse Culture Shock"" was after returning home from a Year Abroad Program in Galway, Ireland. My home town, which before had given me a sense of comfort and belonging, upon returning seemed stifling and bereft of warmth. I moved about my days feeling that something was missing but I had no idea what it could be. I eventually came face to face with the starling reality that my home would never, ever again feel the same as it had before. I had sealed my fate the moment I had boarded that plane the year before.



I don't think there is really any way to describe this feeling to those who haven't experienced it themselves.  It's a little like free-falling.  It feels as if we are floating aimlessly on restless waters.  We feel distinctly ungrounded",10

I am to the point of apply for jobs to get entirely out of the field.  But this one degree just lingered there.  I'd gotten a high pass on my comps, I had a committee, I had started to write the thesis paper....but I could go no further.  I was stuck.  I had written two other thesis papers and a dissertation and just did not have any more in me.  I started to slide into apathy, but I wanted to try one more thing, so I talked to my thesis adviser.  She did say that I could change my paper to a project.  It would cost me more, but it's something that I do feel that I can finish.  It's a huge relief.  As of tonight, I got the final person in place.  I know what the project is.  I will start to work on it.  I want to get this degree again.

97229,3m,"I took my cat Tommy to the vet last month because he had been able to eat for several weeks.  It was the same problem he had in November last year. the vet said he had an abscess in his mouth that was causing the pain which resulted in his inability to eat.  They took xrays and tests and gave him a steroid shot, etc.  I did not get the results or cause, but my cat was better (or so I thought).  It cost me $800 and being unemployed, it took me 3 months to pay back the loan i had gotten in order to pay for the vet bill.  Then in march, Tommy started having the same issue.  It had been 3 weeks since he had eaten much of anything. He was withering away before me and I was terrified he was going to die. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have the another $800 to take him back to the vet and I couldn't borrow again.  So I began an email campaign to the owner of the vet in order to get him to help Tommy and no cost or some type of low fee. It took more than a week but he finally called and said to bring Tommy in.  He gave Tommy a shot and some medicine and said that his abscess was benign.  Now Tommy is doing just fine.  I was/am so happy.  Without an option to pay, I was certain I would have had no option but to put him down.  But thanks to a little persuasion, a kind vet and the grace of god, Tommy is still here today to play with little kitty.  Tommy, little kitty and I are all very happy.",19

97333,3m,"maintains that people suffer cognitive dissonance (anxiety) when they are reminded of their inevitable death. Through terror management, individuals are motivated to seek consonant elements - symbols which make sense of mortality and death in satisfactory ways (i.e. boosting self-esteem).



Research has found that strong belief in religious or secular meaning systems affords psychological security and hope. It is moderates (e.g. agnostics, slightly religious individuals) who likely suffer the most anxiety from their meaning systems. Religious meaning systems are especially adapted to manage anxiety about death or dying because they are unlikely to be disconfirmed (for various reasons), they are all encompassing, and they promise literal immortality.[54][55]



Whether emotional effects are beneficial or adverse seems to vary with the nature of the belief. Belief in a benevolent God is associated with lower incidence of general anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, obsession, and compulsion whereas belief in a punitive God is associated with greater symptoms. (An alternative explanation is that people seek out beliefs that fit their psychological and emotional states.)[56]",11

I had sealed my fate the moment I had boarded that plane the year before.

99802,3m,"Happiness in its broad sense is the label for a family of pleasant emotional states, such as joy, amusement, satisfaction, gratification, euphoria, and triumph.[11] For example, happiness comes from ""encountering unexpected positive events"",[12] ""seeing a significant other"",[13] and ""basking in the acceptance and praise of others"".[14] More narrowly, it refers to experiential and evaluative well-being. Experiential well-being, or ""objective happiness"", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as ""How good or bad is your experience now?"". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as ""How good was your vacation?"" and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory, but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the peak-end rule.[15]",9

So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 86 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",10

102842,3m,"Happiness in its broad sense is the label for a family of pleasant emotional states, such as joy, amusement, satisfaction, gratification, euphoria, and triumph.[11] For example, happiness comes from ""encountering unexpected positive events"",[12] ""seeing a significant other"",[13] and ""basking in the acceptance and praise of others"".[14] More narrowly, it refers to experiential and evaluative well-being. Experiential well-being, or ""objective happiness"", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as ""How good or bad is your experience now?"". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as ""How good was your vacation?"" and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory, but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the peak-end rule",8

105186,3m,"  after attending my sister's high school graduation I left to spend a month of summer vacation with my grandparents. I wasn't sure about the trip because while I liked them a lot I'd never spent much time alone with them. I packed everything I could think of to keep me entertained on the long trip from Florida to Oklahoma.



Though hard as it is to believe I had so much fun on their motor home. Granted most of the time I was sleeping, reading, or listening to music. Those things can only hold your attention for so long so in those periods of boredom I would talk with my grandma.



She told the funny stories involving my mom as a little kid that sounded more like the trouble I would get myself into rather than anything she would have done. Tales of other relatives that had done some strange or suspicious things, thing such as one's husband mysteriously dying or fishing trips that didn't include fishing. I'd never heard most of this because my mother has a bad memory.



We even laughed at the things she remembered me doing when I was little. Like blowing the surprise for my dad by asking mom where the necklace dad had bought her was.On our way to Oklahoma we stopped in Little Rock Arkansas to see the Bill Clinton Presidential library and Museum. The place was made mostly of glass so it had an amazing futuristic look to it.



It held everything from Clinton's life story to what was taking place in America during his time in office and what affect he had on it. Also shining light on Hilary Clinton's active role at her husband's side.When we reached their house it was great. It was kind of like living with a really nice version of your parents.



Grandma was constantly worrying if I had enough to eat and if my cloths needed to be washed. I told not to worry about me that I was fine but she wouldn't believe me. While I was there I also meet her brother Sid.



I'm told the only other time I'd seen him was when I was first born. He was great; I liked him a lot, probably because as grandma said I'm just like him.After being there for two weeks we again loaded up the motor home and headed up to Oklahoma City. We went to the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum.



Before then all I really knew about that day was that some had blown up something in Oklahoma. Though now after seeing the museum and hearing my grandma's account of that day I know all the details. The memorial was beautiful and simple, which I liked a kind of 'less is more' approach.



The grieving people put up pictures and flowers along the gate that ran surrounded it. While two huge black walls stood on either end of a pool of water. Each wall held a time on it symbolizing the start and stop time of the bombing, 9:01 and 9:03. Then to represent those lost gold chairs where placed in a roped of field, mini chairs were used to distinguish the lost adults from the children. It was sad to imagine that the number of chairs could hold the number of people gone in a split second.The next week I spend hanging around doing nothing. Then the last week of my visit my oldest sister Courtney flew up to spend a week with us then take me home. With her there it was even more fun. The three of us would talk all day about things. Then finally the trip was over, Courtney and I got on a plan home. Which went over just fine until the lay over in Dallas. The weather was bad that day and the screen told us our flight was cancelled. So we exited the airport to get another ticket. Yet when we finally got to the counter the lady told us it wasn't cancelled, that they had made a mistake with the monitors. So that was a relief except that the plane was about to leave and we had to go back through security. After all that we finally got on the plane just in time. That's how I spent half of my summer vacation.",40

106185,3m,"It was my second visit to Guruvayur, one of the famous spiritual destinations of Kerala. First I went before my marriage with my entire family with a bundle of personal demands to plead in front of Vasudeva, lord who had rescued his devotees from Demons and miseries. 







I was excited with the ambiance of the temple and its surroundings. That was first experience in my life. This great temple is well-known for its epic stories related to its origin and its devotees. 







It was my two years planning to go once more to Guruvayur but due to several reasons I have been postponing it. This was my word to come once more to Guruvayur. 







We started our journey from Thekkady on early morning in my car. The distance from Thekkady to Guruvayur is 210 km and 5.30 hrs journey. 







Thrissur is well-known as cultural capital of Kerala. Thrissur is famous for its temples; Vadakkumnathan Temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple, Paramekkavu Temple and Guruvayur Temple. Thrissur Pooram is world renowned one because of its peculiarities. It was also considered as the spiritual and cultural destination of Kerala. 







My mind was filled with joy and excitement that I enjoyed from my first visit. My grandfather, who died before ten years, was the motivation behind my spirituality. But he was a complete devotee of Lord Shiva. He used to wake on early morning and do chants of Lord Shiva. He was truly innocent and never uttered a hard word against anyone. He taught me to chant the mantras of Lord Shiva, Dakshinamurthy, the Guru of this universe. I have been practicing this from the age of fourteen but after I went to Bangalore it was stopped. 







We entered to Thrissur town at 6 o'clock morning. My grandmother reminded me, aWe are near to Vadakkumnathan Templea. I asked to a pedestrian, he showed me the way to Vadakkumnatha Temple. The temple is encircled by Thekkinkadu Maidan where Thrissur Pooram is conducting every year. 







We entered to the temple after parking my car on parking ground. The security person warned me against entering with my six month old baby. According to beliefs children below one year of age are not permitted to enter in temples like Lord Shiva and Bhadra kali. 







It is a big Temple by its surroundings and minor deities are located each corner of the temple. We entered in front of the sanctum sanctorum (Sree Kovil). It was my first time visit to a famous Shiva Temple in Kerala. The ambiance of the temple and its surroundings are quite astonishing one for any devotee. When we finished our prayers we came out of the central entrance. We saw a person approximately at an age of 40 standing in front of the main entrance and chanting the mantras written on the board placed near there. I felt the voice that coming from the bottom of his heart and each and every ending of those stanzas he was raising his hands and praising Lord Shiva. The transcendental spiritual vibrations embraced me for some time. I felt my grandfather was with me that moment. 







Time went a lot, we were wanted to go Guruvayur the prime destination of us but we forget it for some time. I have drove fast to get rid of the traffic. We reached at 9 o'clock in Guruvayur. 







The much awaited visit, but I was exhausted with confession. The crowd was almost double compared to my previous visit. After Nivedyam we entered to central shrine Lord Krishna in Balakrishna form. I felt myself awful that I could not keep my words. I started my journey to see Guruvayurappan but instantly changed everything. After prayers we went to Mammiyoor, temple of Lord Shiva. We were stayed one day in Guruvayur and after seeing Nirmalyam we returned from Guruvayur to home. 







I drove my car with a disturbed mind but after sometime I remembered my grandfather's words aLord Shiva and Vishnu are different forms of Supreme God aheada. 







Next time I have planned go Guruvayur first, but I do not know what will happen when I see Vadakkumnathan Temple in the midst of the city of Thrissur.",48

My husband and I have been searching for a church to call home, practically since we met three years ago. We visited several but nothing ever truly tugged on our hearts. So we turned to doing our ""own thing"" at home. However, that just did not work out and our growth was seeming stagnant. Then soon enough, I was only working weekends, so now there was a road blocker yet again to the search. Then, suddenly, I was unable to work due to pregnancy related problems, those conflicts became no more and we visited this church I heard from a family member. When we walked in we had no idea if we were just visiting or if this was going to become our home church. When we walked out, we were blown away by the Lord's presence in that place, the overwhelming welcome and love, and a body of imperfect yet hungry souls uniting with purpose to worship and grow. I feel like God moved the conflicts out of the way in the very best timing. We are beyond happy with the decision we made that day ten weeks ago. Every day we are so grateful for this church. Life is bursting from its seams and we are so joyful thinking about our future with our family in Christ.",13

So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",10

Free walking tour is the first activity we look out for in any new city. Here in Trivandrum, we were told of an active movement called the tree walka. We grab any opportunity of meeting and interacting with the locals. A tree walk sounded like a perfect way to do that!

During the walk, we met Anitha, who started this movement with other like minded tree lovers of Trivandrum. Every Sunday, they meet in a locality, select a species for the day and observe those trees. They have now undertaken a more serious task of conducting a census of the trees and creating a database.

Thanks to Anitha and her colleagues, we saw the original version of the rubber tree. Original, Anitha told us, was alike it would grow in the wild, without being modified for maximum rubber productiona. The only time we had seen it earlier was in the Amazon.

111723,24h,"Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.



Most people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.



But I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.



Iave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.

She was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.



But just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.



I donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.



I remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.



The earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?



Iam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.



And then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a



Holy cow.



The joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a



I knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.



Since that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.



I think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.



In sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.



And Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.",44

I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",10

Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics. There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand",4

I asked many times but ignored and didn't tell me the reason what she will do with that money which she was saving for many years. One day she said, ""You will surely come to know about this"". I always thought she was doing this for my marriage but no.

One day she took me to the place which was totally new to me. It was a house of a poor man and she gave all that saving to him for the marriage of his daughter. It was not a proud moment for me but the happiness flows at that moment, at that house was totally immeasurable. 

That moment cherishes our life with blessings of that man. Then my mother said, 

[?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]

""Thinking good thoughts is not enough, doing good deeds is not enough, when your own child feel proud and follow your good deed, That's enough

[?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]

That moment did not make me feel proud but inspired me to do something that your own child try to follow you in doing good.

As I slowly proceeded and she felt me inside her, I experienced the change of expressions on her beautiful face. She felt pain from my movements, and watching her under me getting those feelings from me was eternal bliss. She guided me and asked me to go further, even during the painful moments. I could feel so much love between us as we proceeded through the act with just our eyes doing the talking. I could feel the trust, love & passion we had for each other in that moment. There was so much purity. We wanted it so much, and finally after years of patience, we had the chance to connect our mind, body and soul into one.I experienced the beauty of pure love with my girl. That moment of love with her is my life's most beautiful moment.

So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores.

There has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.[3] Since the turn of the millennium, the human flourishing approach, advanced particularly by Amartya Sen has attracted increasing interest in psychological, especially prominent in the work of Martin Seligman, Ed Diener and Ruut Veenhoven, and international development and medical research in the work of Paul Anand.[citation nee",5

The card said that they had tried to deliver a parcel to me, but because I was out when they called they hadnat been able to leave it, so Iad have to go and pick it up from the parcel depot.  I was intrigued.  I hadnat ordered anything online, it wasnat my birthday, and I wasnat expecting anything exciting in the post at all.  I had no idea what it could possibly be.  The next morning I went to the post office with some ID to prove who I was, and collected the parcel.  It was a box, about the size of a shoe box, wrapped in a dark grey plastic packaging, with the name of the company ablurta on it.  I was none the wiser, I didnt recognise the company and couldnat tell who it was from by the wrapping. 



I waited until I got home, and then I opened it.  The parcel contained a brown cardboard box which said 'Buddy Boxa on the outside.  Inside, was a collection of rather random, but very charming gift items.  They included a pair of socks made from bamboo; some rather strongly scented soap (I wasnat too sure about that!); a little blank pad of writing paper with a cover decorated with cactus plants, a asew your owna cactus kit (that was very bizarre) and an ultra-thin pen for sliding inside a diary or notebook!  There was still no card to say who it was from, but just an anonymous typed note saying aI saw this and thought of you!a  It was a completely unexpected gift, sent by someone, somewhere to cheer me up.  Iad had a rather bad time recently following a bereavement and losing my job as well, so Iad been quite down, knowing that someone was thinking about me was really touching, and as well as being a surprise, made me very happy.  The parcel came just a month ago, so it is a very recent surprise, but a lovely one. ",16

We're starting a new series on the Buffer blog today with great tips and insights from Joel, CEO here at Buffer. Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:

Today it's a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, I've started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.

One of the most important things I've learned during this time is that I perform the best when I'm happy. It really does change everything. If I'm happy then I'm more productive when hacking code, I'm better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.

I've found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where I'm not feeling 100%. So here are 6 of the things I do:

1. Wake up early

One of the things I love about running my own startup is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my daily routine.

Through experimentation, I've found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, I've found I crave that ""early morning"" feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused. Gretchen Rubin from The Happiness Project mentioned something similar a recent article:

""I get up at 6:00 a.m. every day, even on weekends and vacation, because I love it.""

Waking up early every day requires discipline, especially about what time I sleep. Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.

The power with your mornings is that you will have about 25,000 of them in your life, so there's a lot of room to experiment.

2. Exercise daily

""We found that people who are more physically active have more pleasant-activated feelings than people who are less active"" - Amanda Hyde

In the last three years, I've gone from dabbling with exercise to it becoming something I do every weekday without fail. At first I had no idea what to do at the gym, so I asked my brother, who's a personal trainer. I then went a few times with a good friend and soon I was hooked.

Over time, I developed this into a daily ritual so strong that I feel a pull towards it, and by doing it consistently I feel fantastic and can more easily take on other challenges. I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. I've also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.

3. Have a habit of disengagement

""The richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal"" - Loehr and Schwarz, The Power of Full Engagement

As I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which I've done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else. This prompts reflection and relaxation.",30

117381,24h,"Iall start with the where and when, because that makes more sense of the story.  It was a Saturday morning about two and a half years ago.  I went down to my local park near to where I live in Sheffield, to take part in a 5km run which is a regular weekly event called Parkrun, which lots of people in the UK participate in, there are over 364 different Parkrun events held in open spaces across the UK so it is quite a phenomenon.  This particular event is quite large, with around 500 runners - of all different ages, backgrounds and speeds a taking part.  On this particular day, after the run I was walking away towards home when I suddenly saw a face I recognised.  aHelloa, I said, ahello Lucya she replied, and that was the beginning of our reunion.  The person Iad recognised was someone I had been at school with thirty years ago in a completely different part of the UK.  When she finished school, shead moved away to Sheffield to study and made a home here, I hadnat kept in touch with her, so when I myself moved to Sheffield to take up a new job some 25 years later, I had no idea she lived in the same city.  We met each other completely by chance after three decades, and recognised each other instantly.  It was certainly a surprise!  What made it even more unexpected, was that we were both taking part in a sporting activity.  At school, neither of us had enjoyed physical education, or PE as it was then called, and quite often had skipped school to avoid it!

117408,24h,"Happiness in its broad sense is the label for a family of pleasant emotional states, such as joy, amusement, satisfaction, gratification, euphoria, and triumph.[11] For example, happiness comes from ""encountering unexpected positive events"",[12] ""seeing a significant other"",[13] and ""basking in the acceptance and praise of others"".[14] More narrowly, it refers to experiential and evaluative well-being. Experiential well-being, or ""objective happiness"", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as ""How good or bad is your experience now?"". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as ""How good was your vacation?"" and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory, but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the peak-end rule.",8

So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores.

She said, aWhy will you work in kitchen while I am here?a



I said, aI want to make a roti and I left my seat.



Sister popped up saying, have this roti from mummyas plate, complete your lunch and then make a roti for mumma.a



I said, well! You are falling for a dangerous act.Hahahahah.a



I completed my lunch and started with roti,

This was it! Previously I have cooked many times, but only for me. This was the first time I cooked for mother.



I made a roti and served it to mother.



She made 3 parts of it, one for my sister, one for my father and one for herself.



They all had their parts and I was observing them with suspense about comments.



Sister chuckled, Your wife is lucky, you can feed her deliciously.



Father giggled, Your Gf must have said you to learn cooking this morning.



Mother was little emotional, she said, My son has grown up. Roti is sweet!

118513,24h,"A few weeks ago i was in town and I bumped into an old maths teacher of mine. For this Blog I will call her Mrs A. Mrs A is quite a pleasant lady who always had a big smile and hello for me, which is kind of surprising and makes me feel a bit guilty for some of my behaviours towards her when i was at school. Back then I hated all teachers, the authorities. For me they were the enemy and Iam sure they didnt think much of me either. I recognise that I didnt give teachers an easy time I lacked the empathy and understanding to recognise that many teachers were just trying to do their best to do their job.



That day in town Mrs A and I had an interesting conversation regarding ADHD. First of all we did the pleasantries, asking each other how we were, Mrs A explaining she had been retired for a number of years and then we briefly discussed how great it is to see the sun. In Co. Fermanagh it is always a topic of conversation if the sun comes out because it usually never stops raining.   Then Mrs A asked me what I was working at these days and I explained that I was a founding director of Adult ADHD NI an organisation set up to support Adults and families affected by ADHD etc. etc.. Mrs A said well done Niall, that sounds like good work your doing. Then brightly laughing she said isn't it funny in my day there was no ADHD we called them BOLD CHILDRENa



Well I was glad she said it because I went on to tell her the following story, perhaps not quite as detailed, but she got the idea. It was actually Mrs Aas class that gave me a greatest understanding of how my school had failed me due to lack of knowledge or willingness to support students with various needs.   It was in year 4 that i ended up in Mrs As math class. Mrs As math class was what ye called top maths at my school. The maths class for the brainy students, the students that got everything really easy and the students that automatically understood how a2 + b2 = c2. So what the hell was I doing there? I was still trying to work out when they started adding the alphabet to sums, I must have missed that day. The reason I was there was due to the teacher I had from the year before. For this Blog ill call her Mrs B.



Mrs B was my ultimate nightmare. From the very first moment I met her at the door of her classroom Mrs B was screaming at me. At that particular moment she had no reason to scream at me but I can only assume that she had heard from other teachers that I had been a handful and she was not for taking any nonsense. Nonsense was my speciality, if I couldnat be nonsensical I had no idea what my role was. She ordered me to sit right in front of her at the top of the class and the second I opened my mouth she was down on me like a ton of bricks.",23

Then I feel like a different person, because all wonderful memories flow in my mind and I can talk with my old friend about anything; we can share the best moments of our friendship or our plans for the future. During the meeting we cannot stop smiling and pouring positive emotions to each other. I feel crazily happy because we have finally met. This is obviously the main reason, why this moment is magical.



No matter what your magical moment is, if it makes you feel better, then it is your special thing.",9

119512,24h,"We went to my cousinas wedding. It was a lovely wedding very unlike any wedding Iave yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashersa| never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they werenat invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousinas face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  Heas still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg.



The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  Iave been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasnat there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception.



You may recall that the groomas parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didnt go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.



But all of my aunts and uncles went, and I have a lot of aunts and uncles. It was funny to see all my uncles and my cousin and the characteristic ears of that side of the family.  The family resemblance is especially strong with military haircuts.  All my uncles are ex-military and they bonded with my cousinas army buddies.  Not much has changed in the army in the past 30-40 years.  SNAFUs still abound.  My aunts talked about how the world has changed and wondered if the homophobic father of the groom realized his favorite aunt (after whom one of his daughters is named) was a lesbian.  How nice it would have been if shead been around today and been able to share her relationship with her acompaniona out in the open.



They openly wondered what had happened to my unclea head always been rigid and never had a sense of humor, but wasnat such a hater until he married his wife.  Perhaps he could have been rigid and humorless for the powers of good if head married someone else.  Ironically, the woman he married and is refusing to countenance this wedding is a divorced mother of three| but the difference is that she got the Pope to annul that marriage, so somehow that made it ok.  There was some speculation that perhaps the bride is better off with her mother-in-law not talking to her.



My childless aunt and uncle took over duties of parents of the groom. The groom gave an especially moving speech about how grateful he was for his family to come and show the support they were showing.  The bride sent a lovely thank-you note with the same sentiments.  As the wedding party was breaking up for the folks having to catch planes, the bride and groom made plans to visit all of my aunts and uncles who live in interesting and accessible places.  My family does take care of its own, even when some members refuse to.



My cousin and his new wife are very nice people.  I know they will have a lifetime of happiness together.  And if their children and step-children are close with their great-aunts and uncles rather than their grandparents on my side of the family, well, that's not such a bad thing.",40

I have been to Thekkady recently with this purpose in mind. Thekkady is also called Periyar and sometimes known as Kumily too. Kumily is the place where we normally stay and Thekkady is where Wildlife Sanctuary is located; both are just 2 -3 km apart.



Thekkady is situated 170 kms from Cochin and it takes approximately 5 hours to reach there. For most of the package trips, we go to Thekkady after Munnar which is 110km away or from Alleppey which is about 140km away. The route is a combination of hills as well as normal roads.

Thekkady is famous for the wildlife sanctuary located here. There is boating facility at Thekkady where the boat will take you around the Wildlife Sanctuary through the Periyar Lake. One can see wild animals during this boat ride but need to be very quiet. Mullapperiyar dam can also be seen during this boat ride. Note that, Mullapperiyar dam and Periyar wildlife sanctuary can be seen only during this boating and cannot be accessed by road.



For a guest who opts for one night accommodation, try to reach Thekkady as early as possible and get tickets for boating in lake. Ticket availability depends on the rush on that particular day. Advance booking is possible through KTDC where they charge Rs. 500/- instead of 150/- which is the cost for for normal booking. To do advance booking for boating at Thekkady, you may contact KTDC Lake Palace on 04869 222014 or send an email to lakepalacethekkady@ktdc.com. They will respond back with their bank account details and you can proceed with booking. To take normal ticket, you need to be in queue and need to produce ID card and your personal details.",20

It was a nice that she was in town all summer, now then when she flew back that was the last time I saw her. We haven't seen each other in more than a decade in this april, 2017, we will finally reunite. It will be an emotional yet exciting feeling and I bet you we won't stop hugging each other. Were both so excited. The reason why we couldn't see each other since then was because of the constant schooling between the both of us among other things, but this year is the year that it will happen again. I still remember her sound and the ways she was with me, but I am sure things may have changed because we are much older. Were about 2 years between each other and were like sisters. We try to keep in touch with each other often from Facebook and among other social networking sites and as well as communicating on the phone. She is such a sweetheart. I cannot wait for all the cousins to gather have a huge family reunion at my cousins wedding. A nice picture is required for sure. October seems so far away, but I am not counting the days anymore and going with the flow. I don't want to put myself in all that because its something that I am trying to get better at with patience with going on trips and looking forward to them. I need to cool off on that, but I get so excited and this is going to be extra special because I will see my cousin and it will be one of the best trips ever in my life because its a family reunion.",15

So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",10

I took the home alone option (because I wanted the house to myself).



Every year since, they've taken the same trip to Vietnam over the Christmas holidays. I've spent Christmases alone, with friends, with girlfriends, but never with my parents.

Recently they dropped the bombshell that they will forego their trip to Vietnam and stay home this Christmas to be with me, my wife and two-year-old son. I freaked out, because we rarely spend more than an hour together. And when we do, we butt heads. 



I panicked about how we would fill the hours on Christmas. I thought I had to come up with a plan. Without it, we'd get into an argument about something, whether it's my parenting style, or how much money I've saved, or my weight.

123199,24h,"The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family. I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.

123244,24h,"It is holiest of the seven sacred cities in Hinduism and Jainism. Hindus believe that death at Varanasi brings salvation. Varanasi, erstwhile Kashi and Banaras (also spelt as Beneras), is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and indeed the oldest in India. People often refer to Varanasi as ""the city of temples"", ""the holy city of India"", ""the religious capital of India"", ""the city of lights"", ""the city of learning"", and of course ""the oldest living city on earth"". 

Because I was planning a trip to Allahabad to witness the Kumbh Mela (fair), it was only prudent that I club my trip with a visit to Varanasi. Allahabad and Varanasi are 120 kms apart and fall on the Grand Trunk Road. Varanasi is very well connected by air, rail and road. I reached Varanasi International airport at 10:30AM from Mumbai. 

Generally flights to Varanasi are pretty much full. Thanks to the religious sentiments attached with the town. Apart from believers of Hindu and Jain faiths, Varanasi attracts thousands of Buddhist followers. Then of course there are travelers from all around the world who come to Varanasi to see the play of life and death on the banks of the River Ganga (Ganges) a the holiest of the rivers of India. 



I was fortunate to have my close family friend Krishnakumar Kabra to accompany me for the two days that I was to be there. Krishnakumar has spent most of his life in Varanasi and therefore knew the finer nuances of the city not to forget the tiny lanes (thoroughfare for the locals). I couldnat have asked for a better guide! We had a car at our disposal

Directly from the airport we headed for Sarnath, just on the outskirts of Varanasi. At Sarnath Lord Buddha gave his first sermon. Lord Buddha went from Bodhgaya to Sarnath about 5 weeks after his enlightenment. Before Gautama (the Buddha-to-be) attained enlightenment, he gave up his austere penances. His friends, the Pancavaggiya monks, left him and went to Isipatana (also known as Sarnath). 



After attaining enlightenment Buddha left Uruvela and travelled to Isipatana to join and teach his friends. He went to them because, using his spiritual powers, he had seen that his five former companions would be able to understand Dharma quickly. When Gautama Buddha found his five former companions, he taught them, they understood and as a result they also became enlightened. At that time the Sangha, the community of the enlightened ones, was founded. The sermon Buddha gave to the five monks was his first sermon, called the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. 

Sarnath has been developed as a place of pilgrimage, both for Buddhists from India and abroad. A number of countries in which Buddhism is a major (or the dominant) religion, among them Thailand, Japan, China, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, have established temples and monasteries in Sarnath in the style that is typical for the respective country. Thus, pilgrims and visitors have the opportunity to experience an overview of Buddhist architecture from various cultures. 



Few highlights at Sarnath include: 



The Dhamek Stupa is 128 feet high and 93 feet in diameter. The Dharmarajika Stupa is one of the few pre-Ashokan stupas remaining, although only the foundations remain. The rest of the Dharmarajika Stupa was removed to Varanasi to be used as building materials in the 18h century. At that time, relics were also found in the Dharmarajika Stupa. These relics were subsequently thrown in the Ganges river. The Chaukhandi Stupa commemorates the spot where the Buddha met his first disciples, dating back to the fifth century. The ruins of the Mulagandhakuti vihara mark the place where the Buddha spent his first rainy season. The Ashoka Pillar erected here, originally surmounted by the ""Lion Capital of Asoka"" (presently on display at the Sarnath Museum), and was broken during Turk invasions but the base still stands at the original location. The Sarnath Archeological Museum houses the famous Ashokan lion capital, which miraculously survived its 45-foot drop to the ground (from the top of the Ashokan Pillar), and became the National Emblem of India and national symbol on the Indian flag. There is also a Bodhi tree planted by Anagarika Dharmapala which was grown from a cutting of the Bodhi Tree at Bodh Gaya. 

After climbing about hundred steps from Panchganga Ghat we reached the Alamgir Mosque. Alamgir Mosque, also known as Beni Madhav Ka Darera, was constructed by the Mughal Emperor, Aurangazeb. It is believed that there was once a temple of Lord Krishna at the site where Alamgir Mosque is situated. Being the largest structure located on the banks of river Ganges, the mosque was constructed during the invasions of Mughals in India. Possessing an imposing construction, the architecture of this structure features a blend of Hindu and Persian styles. Standing on the carved pillars, turrets and beautiful domes, the mosque is frequented by devotees and tourists while visiting the Panchganga Ghat. The lower part of the mosque has a Hindu temple and the design of the whole structure presents rich artworks of ancient India. ",45

I am in some cooking mood. You have food, I will make a roti for me"". She said, ""Why will you work in kitchen while I am here?""I said, ""I want to make a roti"" and I left my seat. Sister popped up saying, ""Have this roti from mummy's plate, complete your lunch and then make a roti for mumma.""I said, ""Well! You are falling for a dangerous act.Hahahahah."" I completed my lunch and started with roti, This was it! Previously I have cooked many times, but only for me. This was the first time I cooked for mother.I made a roti and served it to mother. She made 3 parts of it, one for my sister, one for my father and one for herself. They all had their parts and I was observing them with suspense about comments.Sister chuckled, Your wife is lucky, you can feed her deliciously. Father giggled, Your Gf must have said you to learn cooking this morning.Mother was little emotional, she said, My son has grown up. Roti is sweet! She was happy. Everyone was happy.It made me happy.

124244,24h,"In summers of 2017, we planned a short trip to Manali and Rohtang Pass. It was a 5 member family trip on Ford Figo to the great Parvati Valley and surrounding areas like  Manali, Manikaran, Rohtang Pass.

The plan was to drive at night and reach Manali in the Morning. Since I was coming directly from my office, I would not drive in the night but I completely know the Manali route turn by turn as I went to Kasol many times.

I was late from the office and thus we could start at around 8 in the night. As to my relief I was not the only driver and thus with two people, who could drive, we took less stoppages. First stop we took at a Dhaba before Chandigarh. I forgot the name but it was completely shadowed by Gurdaas Mann's pictures, quotes etc etc on every thing in the Hotel. It was a great spot to stop by for a dinner and place was wonderful. Few pics from that Dhaba

We started and went inside Chandigarh City and got passed it, wont share much about the route to Manali as I have written about it in my many other blogs. Just keep in mind about those bad patches on the road.



At around 10 in the morning, we reached Bhuntar. Now we decided that one day we would come and spend at Manikaran Sahib Gurudwara but I suggested that we should cover Manikaran Gurudwara that day itself because its a different way from Bhuntar and just 40 kms from Bhuntar and if we come from Manali we would need to come double the way. So we decided to head fro Manikaran Gurudwara and got passed my second home Kasol and reached Manikaran Sahib. Few pics from the Gurudwara and the temple just adjacent to it.

Around 2 pm, we left Manikaran Sahib and headed straight for Manali and by evening we reached there. We already had a booking through Stayzilla and we went to our Hotel. Got freshened up and went to Manali Mall Road. I am not a big fan of Manali Mall Road and when I compare it to Mall road at Shimla, Manali's Mall road is not even a comparison. It was too crowded. 

We inquired about Rohtang Pass and got to know that there is a restriction of taking diesel Vehicles to Rohtang Pass and one needs to get hold of a Permit to take a Vehicle till Rohtang Pass, but since we had a Petrol Car, it was not a problem for us, as Petrol Car's number was lesser. But another issue happens with the family is over concern for everything and finally it was decided that we would not drive on those Narrow Roads but there is a Himachal Roadways Bus that leaves for Rohtang Pass at 6 in the morning. We would board that HRTC bus. We brought a ticket of the bus, Ticket Price was Rs 500 per person and they informed us the Bus Number. Next day Six in the morning it was raining and we got dropped at the bus stand by Hotel Staff and boarded the Bus and a long tiring Journey started.



In between one also need to rent a suit, a snow suit, I call it a space suit. We rented it for Rs 800 a suit. Again a tiring journey started till Rohtang Pass but the view was awesome. We encountered major traffic jams on the way twice and finally we reached the place. Bus dropped us a km before the main stop and conductor informed all, that Bus would leave back at sharp 1 pm.",30

As I turned my head cautiously I saw a black and white puppy falling off a wet, slippery jetty. I watched it frighteningly fall into the wavy water. I looked very closely and saw the puppy was in a muddle; his small black head suddenly went under the water. I stood there watching it happen right in front of my eyes. I didnt know what to do, my mind was blank. Then my brain suddenly clicked it was like it was shouting at me. My mind yelled sympathetically. I swam with all my might. I knew the life of the puppy was in my hands. I dunked my head under the water and swam deeper and deeper until I reached the pup. Then I clenched my cold wet hands to his fur and pulled him above the water. Once we were back on shore I grabbed my towel and I wrapped it around him and checked if he was breathing or hurt. Unfortunately he was hurt, his little white paw was bleeding he probably cut it on a rock when he slipped. I presumed he was a lost pup. I told my parents the story about him and they let me keep him but they did say that they weren't going to take him back to Sydney. That night dad helped me build a kennel for him to sleep in.

My dad came and took me out of class and spent a long time explaining to me what we would see, and then showing me the eclipse through a little Mylar card. Then I went back to class. That was all.

When I got married, I was 26 years old. Since I belong to a traditional and orthodox Hindu family, it's more or less like a religious and family festival. We invited most of our friends and relatives and the celebrations started three days prior to the event. We had to arrange all the amenities to the guests who came by; such as hotels to stay, food and drinking arrangements and we had to make sure all of them were pretty satisfied. However, another biggest challenge I faced was the raising of the fund for the occasion. Fortunately, everything went well and the day is still a wonderful experience to think about.



On the flip side, the greatest reason why that day is rather important is because, ever since then, I witnessed a dramatic change in the way I live. I had to become more responsible and after all, I got someone to share my life together. I gradually realised, the biggest part in life is to become shoulders and shade, to someone who is important to us, especially at the time of crisis. I would like to conclude by saying that now I am happily living with my parents, wife and son, and my marriage was the first significant step towards this journey. ",12

128512,24h,"There are several joyful events in my life that I can summon up and out of those, I would like to talk about the day that my aunt was blessed with a little baby boy. This was an event that I still recall vibrantly.



My aunt gave birth of the baby in a hospital. When I saw a little prince was crying on my aunt's lap I was like skimming that time. I was very contented when I heard my aunt is going to give a birth a baby. I got very animated and I was counting days when this baby will come. I speculated and anticipated lots of things I would do with the baby. On the day when the baby came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.



I usually used to go look after my aunt. After I went to the hospital to see the price, I was very glad and attached by the event. I heard a baby's crying voice and then went near the baby. For the first time in my life, I felt a strong desire to kiss and hug him. He was so cute and adorable. He was trying to open his little eyes. I thanked God for this precious gift because my uncle and aunt had no children for many years even after their desperate tries. They gave birth to the baby after 15 years of their marriage.



My aunt asked me to hold him and kiss him. But I was so afraid to touch him as I thought that might hurt him. I felt I was in another world that time with the baby. After spending lots of time my parents were ready to go home but I denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital.  This was a thrilling event for me.



Now I have a great attachment to him. His first word was my name. But that time he didn't know who exactly he is calling! So this was the event that I like the most. It gives me lots of happiness and that's why I cherish this memory very much",27
